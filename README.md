# NFT Identity Server

NFT Identity Server is a configurable, stand-alone, NFT IdP server. Though it conforms with the OAuth 2.0 protocol, it does not concern itself with any form of identity beyond NFTs. The prevailing philosophy of this project is that blockchain wallets are ephemeral. They are meant to be used and discarded like toothpicks. With that in mind, solutions that bind identity to individua wallet addresses fall short. For many reasons, NFT ownership is a much better construct about which to determine access to resources.

1. NFTs can be transferred to new wallets as old wallets are discarded (soulbound NFTs are the exception)
2. NFTs represent legitimate ownership in a similar way as bearer bonds
3. NFTs are forever (as forever as the blockchains upon which they live)
